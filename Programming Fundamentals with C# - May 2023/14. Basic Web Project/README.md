# ParkingSystem - Basic Web Project
This is my first **MVC application**. It represents a simple parking system. It holds **Cars** inside memory storage. 

I used objects and class (with 2 properties - **CarMake** and **PlateNumber**,  which are non-empty strings), list to store the details of the cars and Regular Expressions (Regex) to verify the input and if it is valid, the car will be added to the list. In addition, I created a controller, which displays cars and another controller, which holds the logic for adding and deleting cars. 

The functionality of the application supports:

**• Listing Cars**

The list of the cars with its makes and plate numbers looks like this:

**• Adding a Car**

You can add a car when you type the car details in the blank fields: **Make** and **Plate #**. Finally, you should simply click on **Add** button.

**• Deleting a Car**

You can delete any car you want by simply click on **Delete** button which is located next to the car details you want to remove from the list.
